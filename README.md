# Nativeapp

This is a brief description about this native app.

The app is going to be a SIMPLE shoppinglist for people in the average age group. The things this app needs to achive that is some of
the following things: Big font,simple flow, easy to understand and straight to the point. Also so you can save your list and delete.

The point of this app is to "transfer" the papper shoppinglist to an app.
