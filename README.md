# Nativeapp

This is a short description about this native app.

The app is going to be a noraml calculator. The app will have the same functions as normally, also maybe some more advanced functions. 
The ide is to make the layout look alittle bit diffrent. insted of every button beeing on the same page , there will be categories where the user will choose for example "divison" or "divide".
